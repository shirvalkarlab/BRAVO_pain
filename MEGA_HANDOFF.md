## 0. Recent work (newest first)

What changed and why, most recent first. The durable decisions are tabulated in §3; this section
keeps the operational specifics. Per-commit detail: the dated session handoffs.

**TD→LSB calibration + spectral unification (CS-1…CS-4 + Phase 0–3, 2026-06-27).** The vendored
`percept-spectral-repro` transform DSP is now the **primary TD→LSB route** (`k=352.62`; §3 decision 18,
constants in §2a). Supporting pieces:
- **PSD-source taxonomy** (`PSD_SOURCE_TAXONOMY`: patient_event / streaming_event / montage_snapshot)
  separates pooling identity from timeline display category — Streaming is its own category, not
  mislabeled "Montage PSD".
- **PSD→LSB bridge** for PSD-only patient-event snapshots: event `FFTBinData` is linear µV magnitude,
  baseline-subtracted (clamp negatives to 0). Montage law `PSD_bp = 4.789·TD_bp` (r=0.987, n=10476)
  composes to `LSB = 73.63·PSD_bp`, restricted to [7.8, 30] Hz.
- **Per-PRO LSB selection** (`availability.per_pro_lsb`), strict precedence: (1) native device LSB →
  (2) direct TD→LSB transform when a TD-bearing recording overlaps the PRO → (3) PSD bridge only for
  PSD-only patient events in [7.8, 30]. Surfaced on the timeline (`_pro_lsb_by_channel`, payload key
  `pro_lsb`): marker shape = tier (native ● / TD-transform ○ / PSD-bridge ◇), red ring = saturated.
  Live RCS08: 684 PROs × 30 ch → 239 values (51 native, 102 TD-transform, 86 PSD-bridge).
- **Per-PRO time contract:** for a PRO at time T matched to a TD recording, the transform runs on 30 s
  centered on T = [T−15 s, T+15 s], clipped to the session boundary (≥1 s, >10% Missing rejected);
  a 1 s rcs-Hann window slides at 500 ms (≈59 windows), and the **median** in-band summed-squared
  magnitude → one LSB.
- **Shared LSB cache** (`per_pro_lsb_spectrum` + `_pro_lsb_spectrum_cached`, content-keyed memo) is the
  single source of truth for BOTH the timeline and the spectral feature-importance panel — identical
  numbers at any shared band center. The spectral scan's `feature="lsb"` reads `log10(cache[...])`
  (`feature_used="lsb_cs14"`); the old Welch-density×269 / device-FFT rescale path was removed (~65
  lines). Code-review findings 1–5 in `8274d6c` (PRO-set alignment invariant, vectorized per-band LSB
  gather, thread-safe memo lock, double-dip warning for legacy payloads).

**Audit-cleanup statistical calls (§3 decision 19; suite 184→196).** Moving-block bootstrap AUC CI +
DEFF discount; BCa headline CI; per-week threshold-drift trend test. **The one trap to preserve —
C1 guard (do not undo):** BCa's bias term `z0` re-creates the manufactured beats-chance floor that
audit C1 removed, so the *displayed* CI is BCa but the **safety gate reads the de-folded percentile
bound `auc_lo_defold`** — both `auc_power` call sites pass `auc_lo=roc.get("auc_lo_defold", ...)`.
`threshold_drift_by_week` (calendar-time robustness) is distinct from `stim_state_portability`
(per-era / C3, stim-STATE robustness) — keep them separate.

**UX + perf + R-safety pass (2026-06-26, PR #8 → `v3.1.0`).** Biomarker state persistence
(`biomarkerStateStore.js`, localStorage controls + in-memory LRU heap with a `performance.memory`
guard); `run_for_participant` recompute ~63s→47s (threshold sweep vectorized, `_threshold_metric_arrays`
**24.8×** fuzz-verified; spectral CV defaults serial); `_R_GLOBAL_LOCK` (RLock) around every
pymer4/lme4 fit (embedded R is single-threaded; concurrent glmer fits corrupted it). Spectral scan
spans full 0–100 Hz; 8–30 Hz are CENTER frequencies, flagged `adaptive_valid`.

## 1. Project orientation

**What BRAVO_pain is.** A Django (backend) + React (frontend) web platform that ingests
JSON exports from the Medtronic Percept RC neurostimulator and provides analysis,
visualization, and decision support for **closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) for
chronic pain**. The immediate engineering goal is to turn recorded neural data into
actionable Percept sensing/threshold parameters a clinician can program. Subject is
**RCS08** (de-identified code; the only participant with a frozen model so far).

**Repo & branch.**
- Repo root: `/Users/pshirvalkar/dev/BRAVO_pain` (host), bind-mounted to `/usr/src/BRAVO`
  inside the live `bravo-server` OrbStack container.
- Remote: `https://github.com/shirvalkarlab/BRAVO_pain.git`.
- **Default branch:** `v3.1.0`. The old `v3.0.0-alpha` is deleted.
- **Active working branch:** `PS_closedloop_deployment` (off `v3.1.0`), **HEAD `8274d6c`**,
  in sync with origin.
- Other remote branches: `development` (legacy) + release branches `v2.0-alpha`…`v2.2.1`.
  Retired (squash-merged into `v3.1.0`): `PS_biomarker_{actionability,clfixes,module}` (§9).

(Commit identity, the keychain-warning quirk, and other sandbox traps are in §7.)

**The agent bridge (how code runs in the live container).**
`BRAVO/_agent_bridge/` is a stdlib mailbox watcher running **inside** the `bravo-server` OrbStack
container, on the `./BRAVO ↔ /usr/src/BRAVO` bind mount, so the agent can run real code against the
live DB/REDCap:

```
python3 BRAVO/_agent_bridge/bridge_client.py --cwd /usr/src/BRAVO --timeout N --wait M "<cmd>"
python3 BRAVO/_agent_bridge/bridge_client.py --status        # heartbeat
```

- Container: **Python 3.12.3, rpy2 3.5.15, pymer4 0.8.2, pandas 2.2.3, sklearn 1.5.2**.
- **Authoritative test runner (no pytest in container):** `python3 _agent_bridge/run_tests.py`.
- Gunicorn `--reload` makes backend edits live; nginx serves `Client/build`, so **frontend changes
  need a bundle rebuild**. The bridge itself takes effect on container **CREATE**, not restart (§7).

**Live DB / participant.** MySQL/mongoengine in-container; REDCap reachable
(`REDCAP_API_URL`/`REDCAP_API_TOKEN`). **RCS08 live uid = `2e3c75c00d7f4f37b53a048d195f11da`** — use
for all container probes (the old `_pro_dump` uid `1eda36458758461383721208bbe6bb87` is stale post
re-ingest). Cached PRO table `BRAVO/_pro_dump/RCS08_chronic_pro_df.csv` (679 rows). Source device
JSONs at OneDrive grant `/Users/.../PNL/RCS008 jsons` (filenames carry real patient names → keep out
of repo; §7 PHI note).

## 2. Key constants & frozen models

### 2a. Quantitative constants in the current code

In `BRAVO/modules/Biomarkers/routines/analytics.py` unless noted. Line numbers are approximate
(they drift with edits — `grep` the name to confirm).

**The three LSB conversion routes (each DSP carries its own k — do NOT cross them):**

| Constant | Value | Route | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LSB_PER_UV2_TRANSFORM` | **352.62 LSB/µV²** | **PRIMARY TD→LSB** | k for the vendored `percept-spectral-repro` transform DSP (Hann-windowed zero-padded FFT, 50% overlap). RCS08 all-stim median, r=0.9927, RMSE 60.6 LSB. Band-agnostic. Use exactly, do not round. |
| `LSB_PER_DEVICE_PSD` | **≈73.63 LSB/(device-PSD bp)** | PSD→LSB bridge | `= 352.62 / 4.789`. For PSD-only patient-event snapshots; restricted to [7.8, 30] Hz (else `calibrated=False`). |
| `LSB_PER_UV2_DEVICE_PSD_TD_RATIO` | **4.789** | bridge composition | Device-PSD band power / TD-transform band power (geomean, r=0.987, n=10476). |
| `LSB_PER_UV2_VALIDATED` | **269.0 LSB/µV²** | welch256 backup ONLY | `k` for the welch256 band-integral route. **Demoted** to PSD-exploration backup; retained per PI pending a device-PSD refit discussion. Do NOT feed a transform-DSP µV² through 269, or a welch256 µV² through 352.62. |
| `UV2_PER_LSB_VALIDATED` | 0.00372 µV²/LSB (=1/269) | — | inverse of the welch256 k. |

**Other current constants:**

| Constant | Value | Location | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADC_NV_PER_LSB` | **146.0 nV/LSB** (exact) | analytics.py:2548 | Percept time-domain ADC count scale, per Medtronic. Exact. |
| `LSB_VALIDATED_HZ_LO/HI` | **7.8 / 28.3 Hz** | analytics.py:2633-2634 | Calibration-validity window; outside → `freq_extrapolated`. |
| `LSB_DEPLOYABLE_HZ_HI` | **30.0 Hz** | analytics.py:2663 | Device adaptive-stim ceiling (firmware 8–30 Hz). |
| `TRANSFORM_N_FFT` / `_WIN_SECONDS` / `_STEP_SECONDS` | 256 / 1.0 / 0.5 | analytics.py:2874-2876 | Transform DSP: 256-pt FFT, 1 s window, 500 ms step (50% overlap). |
| `TRANSFORM_CENTERED_EXTENT_SECONDS` | **30.0** | analytics.py:2975 | Rating-centered TD extent fed to the per-PRO LSB sweep. |
| `CONVERSION_FFT_SIZE` | **256** | analytics.py:2598 | FFT size the conversion model assumes; only 256-pt modes are convertible. |
| `THRESHOLD_MODES` / `COMPATIBLE_THRESHOLD_MODES` | Dual (256-pt), Single (64-pt), SingleInverse (256-pt) / ("Dual","SingleInverse") | analytics.py | FFT/window per Percept threshold mode. **Single (64-pt) is NOT convertible.** |
| `WELCH_MAX_MISSING_FRAC` | **0.10** | streaming_psd.py | Missing-fraction floor for Welch epochs; above it → all-NaN PSD, row skipped (Fix A). |
| `SMALL_SAMPLE_CLUSTER_FLOOR` / `BOOT_CI_VALID_FLOOR` | 10 / 100 | analytics.py:25,32 | Small-sample advisory floor; valid-replicate floor below which the bootstrap CI is suppressed. |
| `DRIFT_MIN_SAMPLES_PER_WEEK` / `DRIFT_MIN_WEEKS` | 6 / 4 | analytics.py:2226-2227 | Gates for `threshold_drift_by_week` (else `not_assessed`). |

**Transform calibration provenance (`k=352.62`, the deployed primary).** RCS08 all-stim median k
from the vendored transform DSP run on paired `BrainSenseLfp`+`BrainSenseTimeDomain` blocks:
r=0.9927, RMSE 60.6 LSB, median fold ≈1.10×. The stim-off-only k (356.61) is recorded for
provenance only and is NOT deployed. **k cancels in r/AUC only when the feature column is
homogeneous in k** — on a native-vs-modeled mixed axis it does not, so the native-preferred
precedence matters. The 1σ multiplicative scatter is ≈1.26× and propagates into the
estimated-threshold path (`sigma_fold`, `estimated_upper_lsb_lo/hi`). Full derivation:
`HANDOFF_TD_LSB_calibration_2026-06-27.md`.

### 2b. Frozen per-participant PSD→LSB model — `RCS08.json`

`BRAVO/modules/Biomarkers/data/psd_lsb_models/RCS08.json` — `schema:
psd_lsb_conversion/v1`, `generated_utc: 2026-06-25T01:03:47Z`. It is a **frozen asset**
(loaded, never refit on request) so the reviewed cleaning decisions stay fixed.

**Model form (per channel):** `log10(LSB) = a_f + b·log10(µV²)` — a per-channel **common
slope `b`** with a per-frequency **intercept `a_f`** (= device LSB at 1 µV²). The on-board
power gain falls as sensing frequency rises; that frequency dependence lives entirely in
`a_f`, **not** in the slope (per-frequency slope differences are statistically unsupported:
LR n.s., adjusted-R² does not improve). The frequency effect is a **gain/intercept shift,
not a slope change**.

**Pipeline baked into the freeze:** nearest device-LSB sample per offline PSD epoch (each
PSD used once/channel); **±30 min** match window; **fixed 10-min-bin averaging**
(`floor(t/600s)`); Iglewicz-Hoaglin robust-z outlier omission per band
(`|0.6745·(r−med)/MAD| > 3.5` on `log10(LSB/µV²)`, MAD>0 guard); hard **n≥6-per-band**
reliability floor. `fit_basis`: n_total_clusters=685, n_outliers_excluded=33; estimator =
per-channel common slope (OLS log-log), intercept = robust `median(logL − b·logP)` per band.

**Fittable channels:**

| Channel | fittable | common_slope b | R² | pooled_k | n_clusters |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ZERO_THREE_RIGHT (0-3R)** | yes | **0.8545** | **0.841** | 81.35 | 524 |
| **ZERO_THREE_LEFT (0-3L)** | yes | 0.5164 | 0.253 | 278.76 | 81 |
| ONE_THREE_LEFT (1-3L) | no | — | — | 198.67 (pooled only) | 28 |
| ZERO_TWO_RIGHT (0-2R) | no | — | — | 646.27 (pooled only) | 9 |
| ZERO_TWO_LEFT (0-2L) | no | — | — | 333.98 (pooled only) | 8 |
| ONE_THREE_RIGHT (1-3R) | no | — | — | **None (unmodelable)** | 2 |

**ZERO_THREE_RIGHT per-band intercepts** (the deployed channel of record):

| center_hz | n | intercept a | intercept CI | LSB @ 1 µV² |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **8.8** | 42 | **1.7695** | [1.7152, 1.8452] | 58.8 |
| 9.8 | 40 | 2.5995 | [2.4604, 2.6808] | 397.7 |
| 10.7 | 13 | 2.5841 | [2.5527, 2.7342] | 383.8 |
| 11.7 | 8 | 2.5673 | [2.5386, 2.6214] | 369.3 |
| 24.4 | 37 | 1.9275 | [1.9140, 1.9403] | 84.6 |
| 26.4 | 202 | 1.8544 | [1.8356, 1.8675] | 71.5 |

(ZERO_THREE_LEFT fits bands at 8.8/9.8/10.7/11.7/22.5 Hz but R²=0.25 — mostly streaming-only
LSB, treat as unreliable.)

**`special` notes in the JSON (the frozen exclusions):**
- **`ZERO_THREE_RIGHT_8.8Hz` — restricted to ≥2026-03-01.** Chronic 0-3R sensing was
  reassigned off the 8.8 Hz band on **2025-12-05**, then bounced across 28/24.4/26.4 Hz before
  settling. The 8.8 Hz gain falls through a **settling transient** over Dec–Feb (post-2025-12-05
  within-regime trend **−0.078 log10/month, p=0.039**) and only reaches stationarity from
  **~2026-02-15** (p=0.72 → 0.91 at 03-01). The 03-01 cut isolates the stable current-config
  regime (n=42, mean 1.69 log10(LSB/µV²), flat trend p=0.91). Using the config-change date
  2025-12-05 instead would inject the higher-gain declining transient and bias the deployable
  threshold. **CLOSED — see §3 item 16.**
- **`ZERO_THREE_RIGHT_23.4Hz` — excluded** (noisy, inconsistent with its 24.4/26.4 Hz neighbors).

### 2c. Constants/claims later corrected or retracted

- **welch256 `k=269` is no longer the primary TD→LSB.** It was the rigorous stim-off
  paired-block constant (superseding an even looser early direct fit of k≈74.1), but the
  CS-1 session demoted it to a PSD-exploration backup: the deployed primary TD→LSB is now the
  transform route **`k=352.62`** (§2a). welch256 produces a PSD from TD — it cannot consume a
  device PSD, so it was never a valid no-TD backup; retained only pending a PI device-PSD refit
  discussion.
- **8.8 Hz "ρ=−0.64 temporal regime shift, ~3× gain drop, unexplained"** — superseded by the
  documented settling-transient mechanism (see §2b / §3 item 16).
- **Forced log-log slope = 1.1** was explored as within ~0.005 R² of the forced optimum (0.90)
  once 8.8 Hz and 23.4 Hz are cleaned, but the **deployed model uses the per-channel free common
  slope** (b=0.8545 for 0-3R), not a forced 1.1.

## 3. Decision log

Durable decisions and why, chronological. All **Adopted** unless noted. Commit SHAs are pointers
into history, not current HEAD.

| # | Decision | Why | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **rpy2/pymer4 glmer converter fix** — `_rpy2_converter_ctx()` returns `localconverter(ro.default_converter)`, NOT `+ pandas2ri.converter` | pandas2ri context converted pymer4's `glmerControl` R list to a dict rpy2 3.5.15 can't return to glmer. | `33f45a5` |
| 2 | **PRO-timestamp timezone correction** — REDCap `date_time_s1_daily` is California local wall-clock; convert via `bravo_service._pro_timestamps_utc` (LA→UTC, DST-aware) | Device StartTime is already UTC; parsing PRO as UTC smears matches 7–8 h. Census 67/678 within 60 min. | `a4e4e68` |
| 3 | **Concatenation is robust to PRO matching** — keep `FixBreaking` zero-fill concat; no change to matching | Both-ways re-decode: 67 vs 67 matched, 0 changes. | no-op |
| 4 | **Fix A — missing-aware Welch epochs** — TD windows over `WELCH_MAX_MISSING_FRAC=0.10` → all-NaN PSD → skipped | Zero-fill from FixBreaking entered Welch PSDs as real zeros, deflating band power. | `adcaf15` `c438ce1` |
| 5 | **ClosedLoopSim figure-reset fix** — memoize `requestParams`; permanent Plotly `<div ref>`; draw-once + restyle-by-trace-index | New object identity per render refetched all 4 panels → every figure flashed to loading. Hard constraint (§7). | PR #3 `255e0ef` |
| 6 | **Removed the `net benefit` cut-point rule** | Its objective equals `prevalence × cost` — always picks the identical point as `cost` (two buttons that can't disagree). | PR #3 |
| 7 | **C1 — de-fold the deployment-ROC bootstrap CI** — append `float(ab)`, not `max(ab,1−ab)` | Folding hid null bands; a de-folded lower bound can honestly fall below 0.5. **(See the C1 guard in §0 — BCa later re-threatened this.)** | PR #5 `c50be37` |
| 8 | **C3 — signed era AUC + pooled-orientation** — pooled orients first, eras reuse `pooled_flip`, era AUC signed not folded | A folded per-era AUC masks within-era sign reversals (a closed-loop failure mode). | PR #5 |
| 9 | **C8 — tri-state deployment gates, fail-closed** — gate ∈ {pass, fail, indeterminate}; stim-stable gate ABSTAINS when LRT unavailable | A gate that goes green on *absence* of evidence is unsafe for "ready to program". | PR #5 |
| 10 | **C9/C10 actionability** — single-source `CUTPOINT_TRACE=2`; recommend→program Δ; conservative-abstain ramp guidance | Actionable recommendation, fail-closed discipline kept. | PR #6 `b0597f8` |
| 11 | **PSD→LSB conversion panel + frozen model** — freeze per-participant `RCS08.json`, tiered fallback (band→channel_freq→channel_pooled→none); modeled threshold → `indeterminate` gate | Device reports LSB, Welch reports µV²; an unsensed band needs an estimated threshold, clearly flagged. | PR #6 `771f3c2` |
| 12 | **C2 — forward-chaining / out-of-sample validation** — expanding-window blocked-by-week; threshold fit on TRAIN only; held-out AUC not re-folded | In-sample AUC masked forward reversals (26.4 Hz: 0.55→0.24; 8.8 Hz: 0.52→0.37). Last HIGH finding. | PR #7 `d9d58a4` |
| 13 | **Remove 60 Hz mains notch default** — `_band_power_notched(notch=False)` | Implanted/battery-powered, no mains coupling; notching removes real signal. `notch=True` retained. | `f915257` |
| 14 | **Threshold-mode FFT-size guard** — only `COMPATIBLE_THRESHOLD_MODES=("Dual","SingleInverse")` (256-pt FFT) are convertible | A 64-pt Single-mode FFT is a different quantity; same gain can't convert it. | `f915257` |
| 15 | **PSD→TD→LSB back-translation = null** — direct PSD→LSB is the rigorous path | Phase-randomized TD reconstruction matches the direct PSD integral within 0.8%. | `f915257` |
| 16 | **8.8 Hz cut stays ≥2026-03-01** (NOT the 2025-12-05 config-change date) | The config-change date sits inside a declining settling transient (−0.078 log10/mo, p=0.039); stationarity only from ~2026-02-15. Frozen fit UNCHANGED. | `e9d7a80` |
| 17 | **Impedance term `c=1.02` — REJECTED** | Significant only under naive OLS (pseudoreplication: 2985 epochs share 230 impedance measurements). Cluster-robust SE n.s. (p=0.26); a slow-time proxy, not a physical gain. Threshold impact 1.22× < model scatter. Frozen fit UNCHANGED. | `a9c3a01` |
| 18 | **Primary TD→LSB → transform `k=352.62`** (welch256 `k=269` demoted to backup) | The vendored transform DSP reaches r=0.9927 / RMSE 60.6 LSB; welch256 produces a PSD from TD and can't consume a device PSD, so it was never a valid no-TD backup. | CS-1 (§0) |
| 19 | **Audit-cleanup statistical calls** — moving-block bootstrap CI + DEFF; BCa headline CI with de-folded `auc_lo_defold` as the C1-safe gate; per-week threshold-drift trend test | Honest CIs under autocorrelated ratings; keep the C1 beats-chance floor from being re-manufactured by BCa's bias term. | §0, `8509e96`/`2ef0408`/`abe8a23` |

## 4. Open items

> Dropped by PI (do NOT re-open as work): "generalize beyond RCS08", "PHI hygiene". PHI context
> is an operational note in §7 only.

**Currently open:**

1. **Audit backlog — Bucket C/D + low-polish.** Of the original four-lens audit (4 high · 28 medium ·
   24 low), all HIGH (C1/C2/C3/C8) and C4 are resolved, and the 2026-06-27 audit-cleanup session
   cleared Bucket B + four statistical calls (§0). Remaining:
   - **[5]** move the displayed cut-point solve server-side onto the full ROC arrays (mechanical).
   - **[14]** reconcile clustering granularity (per-rating ROC `n_clusters` vs weekly-glmer
     elapsed-week units report different N). **Needs a PI judgment call before coding.**
   - **[42]** operating-point chip (rule + sens/spec) on the LSB panel + LSB annotation on the histogram.
   - **[49]** embed Plotly PNG snapshots of the 4 figures into the deploy export / printed sheet
     (needs the bridge for kaleido — §7).
   - **Low-polish cluster:** [0]/[15]/[22]/[28]/[39]/[43]/[48] — labeling/navigation niceties, batchable.
   Source of record: `closedloop_audit_report.md` + the `AUDIT_TRIAGE_*` decision sheets.
2. **Anchor test** for "timeline circle == spectral point at same band center" — the identity holds
   by construction (one shared cache) but has no live E2E test across the two call sites.
3. **`per_pro_lsb_overlay`** (within-rating sliding-window LSB trace + saturation QC) is available
   but not yet drawn — natural next step is a hover/expand detail on a rating's 30 s LSB trace.

**Closed (do not re-open):** all four HIGH (C1/C2/C3/C8) + C4; figure-reset bug; C5/C6/C7
(figure-honesty); C9/C10 (actionability); 8.8 Hz cut date; 60 Hz notch default; threshold-mode guard;
TD→LSB validation + PSD→TD→LSB back-translation; impedance `c=1.02` (rejected); high-gamma 55.5 Hz
(not actionable — firmware limited to 8–30 Hz; the `freq_extrapolated` guard stays).

---

## 5. Test & build status

- **Backend suite: 234/234 PASS** in the live container via the bridge:
  `python3 _agent_bridge/run_tests.py`. **No pytest in the container** — `run_tests.py` is the
  authoritative runner (globs `test_*.py`, sets up Django, reloads the module). `test_analytics.py`
  holds ~96 of the test functions.
- **Local standalone runner caveat:** running `modules/Biomarkers/tests/` outside the container
  shows harness-only failures (`test_normalize_pro_times*`, `test_pain_scores_emit_utc_t_epoch`,
  `test_pain_series_epochs_match_pro_match_arrays` need Django `INSTALLED_APPS`; model-dependent
  files can't run in the local importlib runner at all). Not regressions — use the container runner.
  Pure-function analytics checks CAN run locally by importing `analytics.py` Django-free in `bravo_app`.
- **Frontend build:** CRA production build exits 0:
  `cd Client && export npm_config_cache=/tmp/npmcache && GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
  NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider CI=false npx --no-install react-scripts build`.
  The repo **commits `Client/build/` alongside source**; nginx serves the mounted build, so the
  bundle must be rebuilt and committed for any frontend change. ClosedLoopSim is code-split into
  **chunk 431**; the timeline is **chunk 768**.

## 6. Key documents & artifacts

**Design spec of record (read before any biomarker-pipeline work):**
- `DESIGN_biomarker_pipeline_v2.md` (artifact `bab71722-0293-453e-9d21-36b77a26cbac`) — the
  biomarker pipeline design ledger v2: Percept RC controller facts + 8–30 Hz adaptive range;
  the corrected five-product BrainSense taxonomy; the **BandCandidate contract v1** (serializable
  interface between the Biomarker module and the future Closed-Loop Simulation module); the
  LSB↔µV² conversion as a confidence-rated FYI; stim-era heterogeneity confounds; the Option-3
  UI split + data-availability-timeline design that replaces `BiomarkerTimeline`. (Its conversion
  section predates the `k=352.62` transform primary — cross-reference §2 here.)

**In-repo provenance / decision docs (current, keep):**
- `HANDOFF_TD_LSB_calibration_2026-06-27.md` — full TD→LSB transform calibration derivation (`k=352.62`).
- `CS3_FFTBinData_units_recon_2026-06-27.md` — PSD-bridge units finding + montage TD↔PSD fit (4.789).
- `closedloop_audit_report.md` (version `e3a12136-e0e1-4fff-b95f-baa42d0a0a46`) — the four-lens
  audit of record (source for the remaining Bucket C/D backlog).
- `AUDIT_TRIAGE_medium_low.md` / `AUDIT_TRIAGE_v3_decisions.md` — the medium/low audit decision sheets.
- Frozen model: `BRAVO/modules/Biomarkers/data/psd_lsb_models/RCS08.json` (§2b).
- Per-session narrative: the dated `SESSION_HANDOFF_*.md` / `HANDOFF_*.md` files (newest:
  `SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-06-27.md`).

(Older per-figure artifact IDs from superseded sessions — early PSD→LSB panels, k=269 calibration
figures, Phase-2 encoding mockups — were dropped from this index; recover them from the dated
session handoffs or `operon.artifacts()` if ever needed.)

## 7. Known gotchas (operational traps)

- **Git identity.** `.git/config` is unwritable in the sandbox. Set identity per-commit via
  `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME/EMAIL` + `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME/EMAIL` (`Prasad Shirvalkar <prasad.shirvalkar@ucsf.edu>`).
  The `could not write config file` / keychain `-50` / `~/.config/git/ignore` warnings are harmless.
- **Bridge: takes effect on container CREATE, not restart;** and the watcher (pid 8) stalls
  periodically (heartbeat age climbs, jobs time out) — fix is an OrbStack container restart, which the
  sandbox can't do, so ask the user. After a commit recycle workers with `kill -HUP 1` in-container
  (VirtioFS needs `--reload-engine poll`; inotify doesn't propagate).
- **`save_artifacts`:** dedups by filename and won't re-read changed content — use a fresh filename
  when content changes; and it only resolves WORKSPACE-relative paths, so copy repo files in first.
- **sklearn skew — correctness risk.** Container has sklearn **1.5.2**; some pickled classifiers were
  trained under 1.6.1. Loading across the skew can silently mis-predict — re-validate before trusting.
- **REDCap PRO timezone.** `date_time_s1_daily` is **California local wall-clock**, not UTC. Always
  convert via `bravo_service._pro_timestamps_utc` (LA→UTC, DST-aware); device StartTime is already UTC.
- **Local decode (`bravo_app`) needs a dummy Fernet key:** set
  `os.environ["DATASERVER_ENCRYPTION"] = Fernet.generate_key().decode()` **before** importing `HelperFunctions`.
- **datetime ns-resolution.** Epoch conversions use `…to_numpy().astype("datetime64[ns]").astype("int64")/1e9`
  at all source sites. A bare `.astype("int64")` gives microseconds under pandas 3.0's `datetime64[us]`
  default and **mis-assigns stim eras** — must be ns.
- **CRLF files.** `Server/APIs/DataAnalysis.py` and `Server/APIs/urls.py` are **CRLF** (all other
  source is LF). `edit_file` preserves line endings; raw Python `open()` writes strip them → giant
  spurious diff. Use `edit_file` for these two.
- **GitHub from the sandbox.** No `gh`/PyGithub on PATH — use `urllib` + `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Bearer, API
  2022-11-28). Self-approval of your own PR is blocked → post the review as an issue comment, then
  `PUT /pulls/{n}/merge` (squash).
- **kaleido/Chrome PNG export is broken in the sandbox** — use `write_html`, matplotlib, or the bridge
  (kaleido in-container), never kaleido PNG in `rocqa`.
- **ClosedLoopSim Plotly discipline (hard constraint).** Panels draw **once** via `Plotly.react` and
  mutate via `Plotly.restyle(…, [traceIndex])` / `Plotly.relayout` — **never rebuild a figure on
  interaction** (commit `255e0ef` fixed the reset bug). Following the Python `ps-plotly` figure-rebuild
  pattern verbatim re-introduces the bug; keep the restyle-by-trace-index pattern
  (`const CUTPOINT_TRACE = 2` in DeploymentRocPanel).
- **PHI note (operational, not an action item).** Stage-1 device JSON filenames in the OneDrive grant
  carry real patient names — keep that folder out of the repo; RCS08 is the de-identified code. Repo
  exports are derived spectral features only; `secrets/redcap.env` + the bridge mailbox are gitignored.

## 8. Key file map

**Backend (`BRAVO/modules/Biomarkers/`):**
- `routines/analytics.py` — glmer converter (`_rpy2_converter_ctx`); LSB constants + converters

  `test_welch_missing_aware.py`, etc.

**API:** `Server/APIs/DataAnalysis.py` + `Server/APIs/urls.py` (`QueryPsdLsbConversion[Model]` views /
`queryPsdLsbConversion[Model]` routes). **Both files are CRLF — edit with `edit_file` only.**

**Decode chain:** `modules/MedtronicPercept/{Percept,BrainSenseStream,IndefiniteStream,Session}.py`;
ingest concatenate toggle at `modules/DataCurator.py:148/150`
(`metadata["automatic_concatenation"]` → `JSON["AutomaticStreamingFix"]` → `Session.py:423`).

**Frontend (`Client/src/views/Reports/`):**

  `DeploySignoffCard.js`, `DeploymentVerdictStrip.js`, `PsdLsbPanel.js`, `ConversionModelPanel.js`,
  `palette.js` (Okabe-Ito). Code-split **chunk 431**.

  `Biomarkers/BiomarkerAnalytics.js` (spectral caption), `Biomarkers/biomarkerStateStore.js`.
- `Client/build/` — committed compiled bundle (rebuild + commit for any frontend change).
- `Client/public/static/docs/METHODS_lsb_estimation.html` — served methods doc.

**Data / config:** device JSONs at OneDrive grant `/Users/.../PNL/RCS008 jsons` (keep out of repo);
cached PRO table `BRAVO/_pro_dump/RCS08_chronic_pro_df.csv` (679 rows); `secrets/redcap.env` (gitignored).
